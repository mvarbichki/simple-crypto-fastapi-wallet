# simple-crypto-wallet
Please note that the project aims to show Python-MySQL DB interactions, but not to work as a real crypto wallet.
The app receives and sends cryptocurrency and writes all activities in the DB.
It could show reports for all or single transactions and send the report to email by demand.
The app shows the exchange rate for a cryptocurrency and calculates by a given quantity in USD, EUR, or BGN a total value
(keep in mind that the site API refreshes every 60 seconds for crypto price changes).


The app is deployed on deta.sh and can be tested here: https://ctotbg.deta.dev/docs#/
